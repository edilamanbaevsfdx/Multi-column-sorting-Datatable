Contribution Guidelines

-   Identifying or setting Engineering standards

    -   small as variable naming conventions
        -   General
            -   Names to be meaningful
        -   Classes
            -   try to avoid ‘name collisions’ ie: NotificationManager - this collides with a system provided class
            -   Must be meaningful.
            -   No classes named Test.
            -   conventions?
                -   Test classes for instance, CLASSNAMETest
            -   One test class per class
            -   for Visualforce
                -   controller vfpageController
                -   extension vfpageExtension
        -   Variables
            -   variable name have to be at least 3 characters
            -   should be descriptive
            -
        -   Methods
            -   start with a verb?
    -   extend into testing
        -   Tests have to exist
        -   Tests have to pass before merge
        -   Test all logical paths, nulls, empty strings, lists, collections.
        -   feature pressure can delay test development, so tests are part of the feature!
        -   if you can test it, you should.
    -   comments!
        -   YES write comments. write WHY comments, not what?
    -   code smells
    -   code length
        -   Standard is loose - based on methods should do one thing.
        -   is it testable? does the method name make sense? does it do one thing?
        -   Rule of 9? 9 lines in a method, 9 methods in a class etc.
        -   Heuristics:
            -   methods should fit on one screen
            -   classes - should be focused on one thing
                -   order of info in a class: Class variables, constants, and Constructors, then public then private methods
        -   Simplifying conditionals and code length
    -   code quality
    -   no features without tests
    -   peer review? / code review
        -   No one likes to hear their baby’s ugly
    -   Per project?
    -   a standard is a foundation for the project: applied at beginning, or retroactively
    -   What can be automated, standards wise?
        -   Tooling: PMD, Prettier, etc.
    -   Can be revisited / refactored, but not necessarily mid-work.
    -   Laying them out vs. enforcing.
